please note that it is not the complete, built project. the actual building and compilation need to be done in the ESP-IDF.
however, this is the complete Main code and the dependent libs.

Components required:
1 x 3904 NPN transistor or equivalent NPN BJT
1 x LED
1 x 510R resistor
1 x 5k1 resistor
1 x push button
1 x LOW LEVEL trigger relay module, 5v input
1 x female USB-C header
1 x SSD 1306 oled screen
1 x LTE module
1 x ESP 32 board
1 x Exernal 5V supply capable of about 2A of current (such as a phone charger)

* schematic will be uploaded seperately
* schematic for a 3d printed box will be uploaded in the future
* PAY ATTENTION TO 5V/3v3 and to the relay being a LOW SIDE TRIGGER!
